#### Our whole world is getting surrounded with datadriven technologies. In order to not get behind, I started to get my hands dirty too, I started to learn to use dataScience techniques and uses in daily real life problems. Right now I am learning it from "Synergic DataTech Solutions Karachi".

### Till now I have learnt some following things:

* Data unwrangling.
* Reducing/cleaning garbage and redundant data, which is also a technique used in SQL in NF1.
* Sorting Data in large datasets such as csv files and making them more readable and intriguing.
* Applying OOP techniques in the unwrangling of data.
* Exploring Pandas and NumPy
* Performing basic level of operations of Pandas and NumPy on larger datasets.
* Data munging with Pandas

### I used some techniques on the following projects:

* `googleplaystore.csv`
* `AppleStore.csv`
* `laptop.csv`

### Ending note:
  This is just level 1 training and knowledge I have about DataScience and there is alot more to consume and learn. So let's hope for the best ðŸ˜‹
